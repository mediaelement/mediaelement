## Attributes

`MediaElement` supports the following `video`/`audio` tag attributes:

Attribute | Description
-------- | ------------
autoplay |	Specifies that the video will start playing as soon as it is ready
class | Specifies one or more class names for an element (refers to a class in a style sheet)
controls | Specifies that video controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button etc).
id | Specifies a unique id for an element; if not specified, the plugin will create one automatically
height | Sets the height of the video player in pixels; you can also indicate percentages
loop |	Specifies that the video will start over again, every time it is finished
muted |	Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted
poster | Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading, or until the user hits the play button. Generally, a PNG or JPEG image. If not specified, the player will use the background color specified in the style sheet
preload	| Specifies if and how the author thinks the video should be loaded when the page loads; possible values: `auto`, `metadata` or `none` (recommended)
src	| Specifies the URL of the video file; this value can also be indicated with `source` tags (refer to the [Multiple Codecs](installation.md#multi-codecs) section for more information)
style | Specifies an inline CSS style for an element
tabindex | Specifies the tabbing order of an element. To avoid the keyboard to focus on this element, use `-1`; otherwise, `0`
title | Specifies extra information about an element
width | Sets the width of the video player in pixels; you can also indicate percentages

The following markup displays all the attributes listed above for more clarity:
```html
<video autoplay controls class="player" id="player1" height="360"
	width="100%" loop muted poster="/path/to/poster.jpg"
	preload="none" src="/path/to/media.mp4"
	style="max-width: 100%" tabindex="0" title="MediaElement">
</video>
```

## Configuration

<a id="standalone"></a>
### Standalone

As a standalone library, _MediaElement.js_ can be configured using the following settings.

Parameter | Type | Default | Description
------ | --------- | ------- | --------
renderers | array | `[]` | List of the renderers to use
fakeNodeName | string | `mediaelementwrapper` | Name of MediaElement container
pluginPath | string | `build/` | Path where Flash shims are located
iconSprite | string | `mejs-controls.svg` | Path and file for svg icon sprite
shimScriptAccess | string | `sameDomain` | Flag in `<object>` and `<embed>` to determine whether to use local or CDN files. Possible values: `always` (CDN version) or `sameDomain` (local files)
success | callback | | Action(s) that will be executed as soon as the source is loaded; passes 2 arguments: `media` (the wrapper that mimics all the native events/properties/methods for all renderers) and `node` (the original HTML `video`, `audio` or `iframe` tag where the media was loaded originally; if `html5` is being used, `media` and `node` are the basically the same)
error | callback | | Action(s) that will be executed if source doesn't load for any reason. Passes same arguments as `success`
dailymotion | object | | See [Documentation](https://developer.dailymotion.com/player)
dash | object | | Accepts `debug`, `drm` (object to load protected/licensed streaming; read [here](https://github.com/Axinom/drm-quick-start) for more information) and `path` parameters to indicate `dash.js` URL/local path
facebook | object | | See [Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/embedded-video-player/api#setup) (and a custom `lang` parameter to indicate the FB SDK language)
flv | object | | See [Documentation](https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/blob/master/docs/api.md) (and a custom `path` parameter to indicate where to load library)
hls | object | | See [Documentation](https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js/blob/master/API.md#fine-tuning) (and a custom `path` parameter to indicate where to load library)
youtube | object | | See [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Parameters); also, a custom `nocookie` parameter to switch to YouTube's no-cookie URL and `imageQuality` parameter if user decides to use Image API to load a YouTube poster based on YouTube video ID (possible values: `default`, `hqdefault`, `mqdefault`, `sddefault` and `maxresdefault`)

**Notes**
1. Vimeo and Soundcloud don't need any configuration for now since they are pretty straight forward.
2. To use DRM with M(PEG)-DASH, make sure CORS are configured correctly, and also your site **MUST** be using SSL.
3. Both `success` and `error` will be available for both `MediaElement` and `MediaElementPlayer`; however, when using `MediaElementPlayer`, a third argument is passed: `instance`, which gives access to the methods associated to the `MediaElementPlayer` class.
4. When using `MediaElementPlayer`, `error` arguments will be: `error` (the details on the error event), `media` and `node`.

----- | -----------
loadedmetadata | Meta data (like dimensions and duration) are loaded

<a id="examples"></a>
### Examples

#### Detect if play/pause event comes from user interaction

```js
mediaElement.addEventListener('play', () => {
	if (player.playUserInteraction) {
		// Example: Send event to Websocket
	}
});

mediaElement.addEventListener('pause', () => {
	const userInteraction = player.pauseUserInteraction &&
		// Handle when video is ended (dispatches a `pause` event)
		player.currentTime < player.duration;
	if (userInteraction) {
		// Example: Send event to Websocket
	}
});
```
