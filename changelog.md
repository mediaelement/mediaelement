## The WCAG update
To be WCAG 2.1 compliant we had to introduce breaking changes. We had to create a new solution to improve user defined values for colors and text size in the browser.
We also improved the semantics and aria attributes for the control bar. By using inline svgs for the control elements we simplified customization with css properties because now `fill:color` and `stroke:color` can be used.
